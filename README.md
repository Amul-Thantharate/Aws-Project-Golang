## 📦 Projects

### 1. LumaBot 🤖
A powerful AWS Lambda-based chatbot that integrates with multiple AWS services for intelligent responses and automation.

### 2. PixlFlow 🎨
An image processing pipeline using AWS services for scalable image transformations and storage.

### 3. Lambda X-Ray Event 📊
A monitoring and tracing solution that uses AWS X-Ray for detailed insights into Lambda function performance.

### 4. GoServerlessCurd (DynamoDB) 📊
GoServerlessCRUD is a serverless backend application written in Go that provides a simple and scalable CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API. It uses AWS Lambda for serverless compute, API Gateway for HTTP endpoints, and DynamoDB for persistent NoSQL storage. This project is ideal for building fast, low-maintenance APIs with minimal infrastructure overhead.
